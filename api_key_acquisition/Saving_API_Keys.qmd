## 1. Preparation for Workshop

To save time during our session, please follow these instructions to get two API keys beforehand.

If you have any trouble or find this overwhelming, don't worry! I will provide a backup key you can use during the workshop.

## 4. How to Store Your Keys

The safest way to store API keys is in a special file called `.Renviron` that R loads automatically.

1.  **Create or Edit the File** The easiest way to do this is to run the following command in your R console. This will open the correct file for you.

    ```{r}
    # install.packages("usethis") # Run this first if you don't have usethis
    usethis::edit_r_environ()
    ```

2.  **Add Your Keys** Copy and paste the following lines into the `.Renviron` file that opens. **Replace** `YOUR_CENSUS_KEY_HERE` and `YOUR_WEATHER_KEY_HERE` with the actual keys you received.

    ```         
    CENSUS_API_KEY=YOUR_CENSUS_KEY_HERE
    OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_WEATHER_KEY_HERE
    ```

    *Note: For this file, it's best practice to use quotes around your keys.*
