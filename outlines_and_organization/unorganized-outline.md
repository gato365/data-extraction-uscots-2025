# General Thoughts about presentation
1. Both: Web Scrape + API
2. Real-World Data Practice and Education Protocol
3. Spotify API Use same API ID and secret
4. Sports Baseball Data [github project exists of thought for teaching material]
5. People will attend the entire day
6. Always supply with Solution Files
7. Fill in code or empty code chunks
8. Files/code should be based on most recent libraries



# Session 1 Introduction

1.  Expectation and Goals
2. Why Data Extraction is important? (Learning how to do it)
3. Introduction: Layout/ Table of Contents
4. Discuss Libraries 
5. How to work around /adapt to changing websites, APIs, and code
6. Best practices, comment (especially hard-coding)
7. Activity: Review (after we create 2 and 3 and 4, we can make this) 
8. Bringing in the data can involve cleaning itto be in tidy date (define tidy data) or that can be seen as an additional step in this experience we are going to consider this to be extraction in that we are bringing information that can then be used to be analyzed or create a visualization. Furthermore each Column Names need to be snake case and Each variable type is assigned correctly.
9. We can create the code and it will work for one day and the developers can change it the next day thus we have to be equipped with tools to make adjust to our extraction code so that we can gain access to the data we need
10. Anecdotal: Spotify Access to songs and how we lost access


# Session 2: API Fundamentals

1. API examples 
2. Spotify, Weather, (one nice 1)
3. API best practices
4. CRUD
5. HTTP protocols / Status Codes. (are these the same)
6. Try our best not to use nested functions as well as using tidyverse functions to our best of our ability
7. Activity: Transformations and visualizations
  a. How deep do we go?
  b. Do they try themselves?
  c. Fill in the blank 
  d. If Take-home: not deliverable during sessions
  e. If take home : new html, new problem? 
  f. Idea for Activity 1: Pull local weather, home town we &Provide an API request and have them modify parameters



# Session 3: HTML Fundamentals - Re imagine as 50 minute experience

1. HTML Examples
2. Sports, Wiki, Football
3. Structured Data Vs Non Structured data
4. There needs to be time spent on going back and forth between the actual HTML page online and the R files so that individuals can understand what data they have access to and what table it is it is associated with
5. Try our best not to use nested functions as well as using tidyverse functions to our best of our ability
6. Evolution of code could circumvent heavy lifting as time progresses. Example, janitor package. Things we can do to clean column names now that a new function/package could do in the future. 
7. Multiple versions of what we do
  a. 1 Spell it all out
  b. 2 Give them something
8. Activity: Transformations and visualizations
  a. See: Nfl outcomes project
  b. Best Practices
  c. Anyhing hardcoded should be evaluate before sending to students in that websites can change from month to month
  d. Idea for Activity 1: Scrape wikipedia, olympics / sports / other
  e. Pairs use 2 different sources and compare the results (think wikipedia vs. sports website (not sure if always feasible)
  f. Think of 3 things to do to clean it (game plan)


# Session 4: Going through 2 Extensive Lessons That gets student acclimated with material



Every API work differently be prepared for this





# Organzing General Thoughts
## Part 1: Outcomes after workshop

A) Join Newsletter and become subsribers
B) Patrons puchchase product
  1. Subscription model where they pay $25 a month to have access information
  2. Seminars where I teach how to teach the material
  3. A textbook/virtual book
  4. Seminars at conferences



## Part 2: How to have great workshopNotes for great Scots presentation 
 
1. Make clear goals in the beginning**
2. Make activities relate to goals
3. Include time for them to do actual work
4. Schedule in break time for talking about
5. I will have a list of where they are coming from
6. Send them message about prep
7. Send them information about lelve of content to do so before hand via email
8. Prepare for No Shows 

## Part 3: Misc

1. Get API Access Token, use univerisal API, to make sure process goes by fast
2. Cost of API, need to make sure they know it possible to get more info but it costs
3. Status codes, teach them about the extent of status codes that will leave them with a foundation
4. The guts of the HTML complexity really is within the code to make the data clean whereas the guts of the API complexity is how the JSON is brought into R that requires deeper thought and intention around
5. website/coursekata will house everything, this github will be for me to organize everything
6. Process of viewers to client should be obvious and easy done
7. Materials: 4 Separate quarto files --> 4 separate jupyter notebook (potentiall 6, two additional notebooks for activity, split class to do API and others do html so they do not feel overwhelm, bring together and how them presnt their finding and how it can be imlplemnted in tjheir classes)
8. Have questions, discussion questions, best practice within each quarto
9. Combine strategies, i.e web scrape for ice cream sales, sports, other, and pull in weather API to join and look for patterns, Transformations and visualizations for each
10. Bring variety of candy
11. Hvae prizes for raffle


Have this paradigm within each session
- Goals & Objectives
- Theory (I do not know what should be here for the introduction & conclusion)
- Practice (what we do with API & HTML extraction)
- (I do not know what to put here)
